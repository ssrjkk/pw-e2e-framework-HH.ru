- Vacancy detail returns all required fields
- Non-existent vacancy returns 404
- Response time under 3000ms
- Dictionaries: experience, employment structure
- Areas: Russia and Saint Petersburg exist

**UI**
- Search page loads correctly

**Integration**
- Search then get vacancy detail - data is consistent
- Area ID from /areas works in /vacancies filter
